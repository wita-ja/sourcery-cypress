# Branching Exercise


1. Create a new file called `Playlist.txt` (leave it empty for now)
2. Add and commit the empty file
3. Immediately make a new branch called `liked-songs` and another branch called `2000s` (both based on the master branch)
4. Move to the `liked-songs` branch using the "new" command to change branches.
5. In the `Playlist.txt` file, add the following:
    
    ```
    

    Few titles of liked songs in seperate lines
    ```
    
6. Add and commit the changes, with the commit message
7. Move over to the `2000s` branch using the "older" command to change branches.
8.  Put the following text in  the `Playlist.txt` file:
    
    ```
    2000s Songs

    Few titles of songs from 2000s
    ```
    
9. Add and commit the changes on the `2000s` branch with the commit message
10. Next, create a new branch based upon the `2000s` branch called `2010s`
11. Move to the `2010s` branch
12. Edit the `Playlist.txt` file so that it says `2010s` at the top instead of
`2010s` 
13. Add and commit the change with the message
14. Run a git command to list all branches (you should see 4)
