# Git Merging Exercise

## Part 1: Fast Forward Merge

**Your goal is to generate a fast forward merge. Demonstrate that you understand how FF merges work by creating one on your own!**

Make a new branch from gitExercise called fast-forward.
Do some work in the repo such that when you merge the new branch into gitExercise, it results in a fast forward merge.
Merge that branch into gitExercise and see if you were right!

## Part 2: Merge Commit (No Conflicts)

Your goal is to generate a merge commit with NO MERGE CONFLICTS.

Create a new branch called no-merge-conflicts. 
Make some changes to the repo such that when you merge the new branch into gitExercise, it results in a merge commit.
The merge should not result in any conflicts. 
Merge that branch into gitExercise and see if you were right!

## Part 3: Conflicts!

Your goal is to generate merge a conflict!

Create a new branch called conflict.
Make some changes to the repo such that when you merge the new branch into the gitExercise branch, it results in a merge conflict.
Merge that branch into gitExercise and see if you were right!
Resolve the conflict!
