1. Create a file called `diary.txt`.  Inside the file, add the following:
    
    ```
    I love  watching anime
    ```
    
2. Add and commit the changes on the `gitExercise` branch
3. Create a new branch called `the-truth`.  Switch to it.
4. In the `diary.txt` file, erase the contents and instead replace it with:
    
    ```
    I HATE watching anime
    I HATE watching anime
    I HATE watching anime
    I HATE watching anime
    I HATE watching anime
    ```
    
5. Save the file
6. Switch over to the `gitExercise` branch!
7. The `diary.txt` file still contains the HATE message?  **Quick, stash the changes**
8. Your `diary.txt` file should now only contain "I love watching anime"
9. Add more lies to the `diary.txt` file:
    
    ```
    I love watching anime
    I love watching anime
    I love watching anime
    ```
    
10. Add and commit your changes on the `gitExercise` branch.
11. Now switch over to the `the-truth` branch.
12. Retrieve the earlier changes that you stashed (I HATE watching anime x 5)
13. Add and commit the changes on the `the-truth` branch
14. Delete stash if you used command which doesn't delete it
